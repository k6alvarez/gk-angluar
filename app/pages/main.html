<h1>About Our Kennel</h1>
<p>At Gillette Kennels, we offer a comfortable and safe place for your pets to stay while your are away! Each of our runs provide your dog with spacious, private, indoor and outdoor areas. Inside we feature central air conditioning and in-floor radiant heat. It's so cozy, some of our guests prefer sleeping NEXT to their beds! The outside areas are designed to be bright and airy - never confining! Each run opens into one of our 4 large excercise yards where your dog can enjoy exercise time and playtime with staff, or even pool time in the summer! We are nested on 8 country acres, perfect for long, meandering walks...</p>

<p>Don't forget about that special cat in your life! Our catery is located off the reception area in a sound-proof, sun filled room. For your cat's pleasure we offer 5 tier kitty condos - no cages! The entire room, complete with rocking chairs, cozy baskets, and wide window sills, is available on a first come- first serve basis as well!</p>

<p>Gillette Kennels is also proud to offer Obediance Training ranging from puppy head start classes to basic, intermediate, and advanced levels!</p>
